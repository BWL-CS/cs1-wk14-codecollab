		<p>This week's CodeCollab demonstrates two different <strong>CSS Animations</strong>! Look at the <code>style.css</code> file and focus on the two <code>@keyframes</code> sections which define the sequence of the two animations. The first animation is applied to the emoji, and the second animation is applied to the box.

		<p><em>HINT: </em>Try removing interesting CSS rules (one line at a time), press RUN, and observe any changes in
			the Webview. Then, add it back in, and try again but remove a different rule. This is how you can figure out what
			any CSS rule does!</p>
